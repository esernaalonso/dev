        menuinst: cross platform menu item installation
        ===============================================
        
        This package is was originally developed and maintained by Enthought
        under the name AppInst.  The name appinst is a rename of what used
        to be called 'wininst'.
        
        Usage on Windows:
        =================
        
        This application is used by Conda to create shortcuts on a wide variety of
        systems.  To create shortcuts, you'll need to add a menu entry file named
        **menu-windows.json** to your conda recipe.  An example file's contents would be:
        
        .. code-block:: javascript
        
            [
                {
                    "name": "IPython (Py __PY_VER__)",
                    "pyscript": "${PYTHON_SCRIPTS}/ipython-script.py",
                    "icon": "${MENU_DIR}/IPython.ico"
                }
            ]
        
        There can be more than one dictionary per JSON file (one per shortcut).
        
        **Note:** two fields are required for each shortcut: "name" and some action type.
        
        By default, this puts your shortcut under the Anaconda menu entry.  To create your own folder, you can add additional keys:
        
        .. code-block:: javascript
        
            {
                "menu_name": "World",
                "menu_items":
                    [
                        {
                            "name": "Hello World",
                            "pyscript": "${PYTHON_SCRIPTS}/helloworld-script.py"
                        }
                    ]
            }
           
        
        Make sure that you copy the menu-windows.json file in your blt.bat script:
        
        .. code-block:: 
        
            copy menu-windows.json %MENU_DIR%\
        
        Supported action types on Windows:
        ----------------------------------
        
          * **pyscript**: Run supplied python script with interpreter on PATH
          * **pywscript**: Run supplied python script with pythonw interpreter on PATH
          * **webbrowser**: Open system default web browser to supplied link
          * **script**: Execute supplied argument (e.g. batch file, executable, etc.)
        
        Making icons accessible:
        ------------------------
        
        To make your desired icon accessible, copy it in your bld.bat file to %MENU_DIR%, which conda defines.
        
        .. code-block::
        
            copy %RECIPE_DIR%\IPython.ico %MENU_DIR%\
